# Web Scraping

Using Python requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, Amazon website is scraped to retrieve the top, best selling books, which is subsequently stored in a CSV file in an ouput folder.

Run the code using `python3 <file name>`. `com_bestseller.py` scapes amazon.com website and `in_bestseller.py` scrapes amazon.in website.
